# CSUGlobal's CSC405 Graphics's Final Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple WebGL program that demonstrates the hidden surface problem and utilizes the `Painter's Algorithm`.

## How It Works
The application starts by initializing the setup code and the render code. Next, the triangles are drawn from the back to the front, and the front triangle overlaps and covers the two triangles in the back.

## Running the Application
1. Compile the JavaFX application using your favorite IDE or command line.
2. Launch the application, and interact with the menu options.

## Requirements
- HTML file
- JavaScript file
